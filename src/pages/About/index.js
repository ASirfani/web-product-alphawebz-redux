                    It might not seem like it, but product.com has thousands of lines
                    of code powering it and it's quite popular! Jake likes design and I do
                    all the coding as well as make sure the site is fast. If it's running
                    slow or you have any suggestions, please <NavLink className="a" to={'/contact-us'}>contact us</NavLink>.

                    At its core, DEU.com uses the <a className='a' href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15883556/'>Mifflin-St Jeor</a> formula to
                    calculate an estimate of your <a className='a' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate'>Basal Metabolic</a> Rate, and then we adjust
                    the numbers to take your activity level into account.

                    Optionally, if you fill out the body fat percentage field, the calculator
                    will instead use the Katch-McArdle Formula, which is the most accurate
                    formula of all. If you don't know your body fat %, you can pick up a pair
                    of cheap body fat calipers on Amazon, or find a place (try University
                    health departments) that offers DEXA scans. DEXA scans are the gold-standard
                    in determining your body fat percentage and generally cost between $50 - $100.
